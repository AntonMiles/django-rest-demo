# django-rest-demo
A demonstration of a Django REST framework API

The 'Super User' for the Admin dashboard, which will live at 'localhost:8000/admin' is named 'demouser' wth the password 'password'. To stand it up simply takes an install of the requirements (if under a virtual environment make sure to activate it) and the a simple run of 'python manage.py runserver'.
